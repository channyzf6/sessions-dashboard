  #   - Codex hasn't flushed session_meta when detection runs.
  #   - Gemini's chat file isn't created until the first user message.
  #   - Claude is the default fallback, but only wins when NO other host
  #     has any transcript in the cwd; once Gemini/Codex have ever been
  #     used here, Claude's fresh sessions can be mis-routed to whichever
  #     of them was touched most recently.

  # skips the probe entirely and makes detection deterministic. The
